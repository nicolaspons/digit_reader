# digit_reader
Neural Network that recognizes digits with Python, TensorFlow and Keras

Test evaluation accuracy : 0.9711

This is a Jupyter notebook file, you can just reuse the model that has been saved.

In order to use it:
  - check that tensorflow is updated (I used the version 1.12.0)
      you can write this following command to update it "pip install --upgrade tensorflow"
  - check that matplotlib is installed
      you can write this following command to install it "pip install matplotlib"
      
You can load and reuse the model "first_num_reader.model" like this "new_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('first_num_reader.model')"
